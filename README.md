    -   #### Colour Scheme

        -   The two main colours used are Code Insititue red, and white.

    -   #### Typography

        -   The Roboto font is the main font for paragraphs and used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in  programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
        
        -   The Bebas Neue is the main font for headlines with Cursive as the fallback.

    -   #### Imagery

        -   Imagery is important. The imagery is there to inspire, show details about the product and showing the product in real-life scenarios.
